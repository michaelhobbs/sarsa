# sarsa
SARSA

Sarsa implemented from scratch in Python. Inspired by real-life neuroscience experiments run on rats. This experiment simulates a rat put on a table with a piece of cheese. Falling off the table is a negative outcome and finding the cheese is positive.

Implementation details:
- continuous state space
- function approximation on state
- eligibility trace

The report can be found at [hobbs.im](https://hobbs.im/report.html) and presents implementation details, effects of various model parameters, limitations of the algorithm, and possible extensions to the project.
